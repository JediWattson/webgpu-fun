# WebGPU-fun

This started as a challenge for me to lean about ray tracing using webgpu, and technically I haven't gotten to that yet with this, but I decided to abstract out some of the configuration data and flatten things out. One thing about webGPU that you might notice is that there's a lot of ancestor dependencies floating around. Sometimes it difficult to curate the best sequence of functions to ensure the optimal loading. Hopefully I achieved this here, such that all you have to do is configure the assets you like and set them in there.

Feel free to give me any suggestions for DX improvements!

Right now you just need to:

- npm i
- npm run dev

and you're all set
